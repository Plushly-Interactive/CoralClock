# Blocked page quotes

A quote is displayed at the bottom of the blocked page card. Every quote belongs to a time-of-day bucket (morning / afternoon / evening / night) and may optionally be site-specific or marked as a signature quote. The system favors quotes the user hasn't seen yet, cycling through the full pool before repeating.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to see a short quote when I'm blocked so the interruption feels intentional rather than punitive.
- As a user, I want the quotes to vary and eventually cycle so they don't feel stale.
- As a user, I want to add my own signature quotes so the feature reflects my own voice.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A quote is displayed on every blocked page load.
- [ ] Every quote has a `bucket`; the draw prefers quotes matching the current time of day.
- [ ] Signature quotes (`signature: true`) have a 10% chance of being selected; they are drawn first, before site-specific and regular quotes.
- [ ] Site-specific quotes (`site` field set) within the current bucket have a 50% chance of being selected when the blocked site matches.
- [ ] Otherwise a regular quote from the current bucket is drawn.
- [ ] In all three tiers (signature / site / regular), unseen quotes are preferred; when all quotes in a tier+bucket are exhausted, `seenQuoteIds` resets and cycling begins again.
- [ ] If a quote has no author, only the quote text is shown (no "— " attribution line).
- [ ] Seen quote IDs are persisted in `chrome.storage.local` and survive service-worker restarts.

## Scope

### Surfaces involved

| Surface | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/blocked/` | Renders the quote and runs the selection logic |
| `src/shared/quotes.js` | All quote data and selection function — new file |

### Files likely to change

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/blocked/blocked.html` | Already has `#quote` and `#quote-author` elements |
| `src/pages/blocked/blocked.js` | Replace inline quote array with import from `quotes.js` |
| `src/shared/quotes.js` | New file — quote data and `pickQuote()` export |

### Storage / tracking

| Key | Shape | Read by | Written by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `seenQuoteIds` | `string[]` | `quotes.js` | `quotes.js` | IDs of quotes shown at least once; reset to `[]` when all non-signature quotes in the active bucket have been seen |

### Quote object format

```js
{
  id: 'string',           // stable kebab-case slug, never reuse or rename
  text: 'string',
  author?: 'string',      // omit for anonymous / joke quotes
  bucket: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening' | 'night',
  site?: 'string',        // substring matched against rule.target (e.g. 'youtube')
  signature?: true,       // marks user's personal quotes — 10% draw chance
}
```

Time-of-day ranges (local hour):
- **morning** — 6–10
- **afternoon** — 11–16
- **evening** — 17–22
- **night** — 23–5

### Selection algorithm

Given the current bucket `B` and blocked site target `T`:

1. **Signature tier** — if `Math.random() < 0.10`: draw from signature quotes in bucket `B`, preferring unseen.
2. **Site tier** — else if any site quotes in bucket `B` match `T` and `Math.random() < 0.5`: draw from those, preferring unseen.
3. **Regular tier** — else: draw from non-signature, non-site quotes in bucket `B`, preferring unseen.
4. In each tier, "preferring unseen" means: filter to IDs not in `seenQuoteIds`; if none remain, reset `seenQuoteIds` to `[]` and use the full tier set.
5. Save the drawn quote's `id` to `seenQuoteIds`.

### Signature quotes

Signature quotes are added in a clearly marked `// SIGNATURE` section of `quotes.js`. They are written by the user (told to Claude, who adds them with a stable ID). They participate in the same bucket and seen-tracking system as built-in quotes.

## Edge cases

- No quotes defined: render nothing — `#quote` stays hidden.
- Storage read fails: fall back to a random draw from the full bucket without tracking.
- Current bucket has no quotes of the drawn tier: fall through to the next tier rather than showing nothing.

## Out of scope (v1)

- UI for managing signature quotes — added by editing the file directly.
- Syncing seen quote state across devices.
- Per-rule quote overrides.
